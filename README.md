**Benchmarking for Government Performance: A Practical Guide**

Benchmarking is the ongoing process of comparing and measuring an organization’s performance—either against its own historical data or in relation to similar organizations. It equips governments with actionable insights to improve operations, deliver better outcomes, and promote accountability. Benchmarking can be adopted by governments of all sizes and capacities as a core component of effective performance management.

This concise guide, developed by the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University (GovEx)—a partner in Bloomberg Philanthropies’ What Works Cities initiative—offers a practical introduction to benchmarking. It includes real-world examples and quick access to helpful resources. The guide also covers the use of **proxy measures**, a related tool that allows governments to assess progress when direct measurement isn’t feasible.

Inside this guide, you’ll find:

* Clear definitions of key terms
* Real-life applications of benchmarking and proxy measures
* A curated list of resources to support implementation

Whether your government is just beginning its performance journey or looking to refine established practices, this guide provides the tools to make benchmarking and proxy measurement part of your strategic improvement efforts.
