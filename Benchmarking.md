# What is Benchmarking?

**What Does Success Look Like? The Power of Benchmarking in Government**

Benchmarking seeks to answer one of life’s most persistent questions: _What does success look like?_ As individuals, we engage in informal benchmarking all the time. We compare ourselves to friends, peers, and colleagues:

* _I should be earning more—my coworker makes more and we’re the same age._
* _I should own a house by now—most of my friends already do._

While this kind of comparison can be unhelpful or even unhealthy on a personal level, benchmarking takes on a much more constructive role within government. That’s because public sector organizations share widely accepted goals rooted in the public good. Governments aim to:

* Help individuals, communities, and businesses thrive
* Promote health, safety, and security
* Educate children with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed
* Responsibly manage limited public resources
* Ensure people with access and functional needs are safe, included, and empowered

Given these shared objectives, it’s both appropriate and valuable for governments to compare their performance with others. This is known as **external benchmarking**—evaluating performance relative to peer organizations or jurisdictions.

But benchmarking doesn’t always require outside comparisons. A strong starting point is **internal benchmarking**: comparing your current performance to your past performance. This helps track progress over time and ensures accountability for continuous improvement.

Whether internal or external, benchmarking is a powerful tool to guide government action, measure success, and ultimately deliver better results for the public.
