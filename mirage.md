# The Benchmarking Mirage

\##The Benchmarking Mirage

Unless you live in Minneapolis or St. Paul, there is no such thing as a "twin city." Many governments are searching for a meaningful comparison, but it can be a frustrating path. The issues below highlight the reasons why finding an exact "twin" is a mirage - as soon as you find a good comparison, you realize there is more complexity to take into account. Instead of trying to find an exact match, find a cousin with a strong relationship to one specfic service area.

**Thinking about Population**

Population is a simple word with a lot of embedded complexity. _Population volume_, the number of people who live a jurisdiction, is important. However, comparing one jurisdiction to another based solely on the population volume is not enough. _Population density_, a measure of population volume per unit area, is also critical. For example, Chicago is America's third most populous city, [but is the 14th in population density](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-26-h1.20140927.PNG) - so comparing [Chicago](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=dfa1866898254e8c8e4eb7b70af99ed4) to [New York](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=80f9b95a4ce0491091f1477710f6a91d) and [Los Angeles](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=5913b5311e6449909e4139117c96a878) based on population volume alone can disregard important differences in the distribution of people across geographic areas. _Population demographics_, quantifiable characteristics of a given population, also matter tremendously. For example, Phoenix and Philadelphia have similar total populations (between 4 and 6 million depending on what geographic boundaries you include). However, Philadelphia is four times as dense as Phoenix, and Phoenix has almost three times as many Hispanic residents as Philadelphia. _Population fluctuations_, changes in population over time, also matter. Some jurisdictions see huge increases in population during the workday, while others stay roughly the same. Some jurisdictions are losing residents while others are gaining them. Taking all of these population considerations into account makes it nearly impossible to find an exact jurisdictional comparison. So consider narrowing the scope of what you are trying to benchmark against. Instead, consider using other factors, which correlate to population, to find comparable jurisdictions. For example, find a jurisdiction with the same weather or geographic landscape. Look for cities with the same type of transportation infrastructure (i.e., highways vs. subways), or cities with comparable budget expenditures. These characteristics might be a more direct route to finding a comparable jurisdiction.

**Thinking about Mobility**

Mobility plays a vital role in shaping a jurisdiction’s economy and population. Cities with strong public transportation networks—such as rail and bus systems—often develop in ways that differ significantly from those primarily connected by highways. The rise of car-sharing services and ride-hailing platforms like Uber is also transforming how people navigate urban spaces.

However, not all transportation systems are directly comparable. For example, simply having a bus system doesn’t mean two cities are equivalent benchmarks. To make meaningful comparisons, factors such as ridership levels, the number of lines and stations, total service miles, and fare structures should be taken into account.

When evaluating highway-connected jurisdictions, it’s important to consider their relationship to geopolitical boundaries, levels of traffic congestion, and patterns of urban sprawl. For instance, benchmarking DMV services in a city where most residents depend on cars should differ significantly from benchmarking in a city where public transit is the primary mode of transportation.

Thoughtful benchmarking in the transportation sector requires more than surface-level similarities—it demands a deeper understanding of how people move, why they move that way, and how infrastructure supports or limits those choices.

**Thinking about Infrastructure**

The United States is a young country, but the infrastructure varies widely and is aging at varying rates. Housing stock in the Northeast faces a different set of issues than housing stock on the west coast. Transportation networks were built at different times, with varying levels of reach into suburbs and across geopolitical boundaries. Technology is unevenly deployed across jurisdictions based on resources and proximity to academia and the tech sector. Building codes on the west coast focus on earthquake resiliency more than building codes on the east coast. Some jurisdictions have [combined sewer/stormwater systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_sewer#CSOs_in_the_United_States) and others keep them separate. These infrastructure differences create important differences in the way services get delivered and should be taken into account when comparing one place to another.

**Thinking about Politics and Governance**

All politics is local, and that has a huge impact on external benchmarking. Jurisdictions have varying governance structures. Some have [Strong Mayors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor%E2%80%93council_government) and others have [Strong Council/Managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council%E2%80%93manager_government). Some jurisdictions have Mayoral control of schools, others have an elected school board. Some cities deliver health and human services, while many cities reserve those services for the county governments. Some services are delivered based on political boundaries, others are delivered based purely on physical boundaries. For example, Chicago previously conducted trash collection by Ward while most cities pick up trash based on geography.
